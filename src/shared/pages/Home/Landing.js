          I solve complex problems with Software and Artificial Intelligence
        </h4>
        <p>
          I translate problem statements into solutions that solve the problems;
          building and shipping APIs and Micro-services for internal and client
          projects, developing custom algorithms to tackle domain problems, and
          developing custom analytics solutions for automating client processes.
          I currently lead the digital solutions development project team for
          the GRC Unit at KPMG, developing and maintaining scalable and quality
          software and analytics solutions for clients and internal use cases.

              I am full-stack software, and analytics driven solutions
              developer, who is skilled in architecting solutions in complex
              data-oriented environments and building models that cut through
              the complexities of business problems. I am energised by
              technically challenging, competitive and collaborative
              environments, where learning, personal and technical development,
              spontaneously align with organisational goals.
