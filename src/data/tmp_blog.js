While this served its purpose, moving into software development, is completely different area,although the programming language has stayed the same, there a number of things that need to be covered in order to have a good python software or API development project, many of which are poorly covered on the internet, and one key area is how to structure your python projects. Tutorials typically write code in a single file, which is not necessarily true of actual software development projects, and developers get confused on selecting the best way to structure projects. This article however, hopes to simplify the concepts behind structuring your projects, and it especially targets developers who want to move from writing basic scripts to building complex multi-module softwares, or even building reusable python packages for the PyPi index.
